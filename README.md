A mod for HBS' Necropolis adding unused assets and new game actions / item behaviors to the game.

This particular repository is dedicated to the new game actions and item behaviors and so does not contain the CSV files used to add the unused assets to the game's loot tables or otherwise reintroduce them to the game.
